                                <p>I started out at <a href="https://bunq.com">bunq</a> as a Data Science Intern. After 4 months, I was offered to continue my contract as a part-time Data Scientist (3-4 days a week). In this position, I worked for about a year.</p>

                                <p> The first project that I worked on was building a <b>Customer Lifetime Value model (CLV)</b>. Essentially, this was an end-to-end ML project which involved all the steps starting from Data Wrangling and Model Training to Model Deployment and Continuous Performance Monitoring.</p>

After 14 days, the mean absolute error drops to 5%. Previously, recognizing customers' value was only possible after ~3 months of their signup.</p></li>

                                <p>After CLV, I have implemented multiple other projects such as creating the Data Lexicon which implied creating the universal source of truth with more than 100 Data Definitions. These Definitions were put on a webpage with accompanying relevant live graphs/dashboards for each of them. Such a project was incredibly valuable since it solved a part of the problem of inefficient communication between employees in the company. Having the ability to consult the Data Lexicon, everyone started speaking the same language to each other.</p>

                                <p>Next to that, I have been involved in the process of mentoring 2 data team employees which implied introducing them to company culture, as well as helping them to get familiar with the company's tech stack and answering any questions that could possibly occur during onboarding and after.</p>

                                <p>The last project that I worked on was Keywords Generation using NLP and, in particular, GPT-3. To do that, we have utilized Natural Language Processing models to authomatically generate campaigns' copylines and relevant keywords. This allowed to set up an never-ending number of hyper-targeted marketing campaigns. Such campaigns achieved significantly higher Estimated Customer Lifetime value per $ invested in them. </p>
