                                <p>Here is the <b>abstract</b> of the work performed in that paper: "This paper investigates the use and relevance of data mining techniques for online direct marketing. Cookie log files are obtained and transformed into time-aggregated web user characteristics to predict which users are likely to purchase. Given these characteristics, users observe relevant banners. Modern classification techniques, i.e., support vector machines (SVM), random forests (RF), bagging (BA), and boosting (BO), are compared with classic data mining techniques, i.e., multinomial logistic (MNL) regressions, neural networks (NN), and Naive Bayes (NB). We found that, after feature selection, all modern techniques significantly outperform the classic methods NN and NB, accuracy-wise. MNL performs similarly to BO and better than BA. RF performs best with an average accuracy of 70.7%, followed by SVM with an average accuracy of 67.6%. The RF model has led to a decrease in banners served, while preserving the number of sales. Several novel time-related features have also been proposed for online bannering."</p>

                                <p>The second paper that we published is <b><a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dss.2021.113541">"A competing risks model based on latent Dirichlet Allocation for predicting churn reasons."</a> </b>In this paper, we have looked into the industry of telecommunication services. In particular, we have aimed to utilize the textual data that these companies possess and forecast their customers' churn.</p>
                                <p>Its <b>abstract</b> is given as follows: "Due to low switching costs and stiff competition, customer relationship management has become a central component in the marketing strategy of telecommunication service providers. Since the costs of acquiring a new customer are five times higher than the costs of maintaining an existing customer, telecommunication service providers are eager to reduce the churn rate. A solid understanding of customer churn behavior can help to address this problem. Reducing the churn rate can translate into significant revenue gains and might provide the edge to outperform the competitor. In this paper, we predict the propensity to churn for customers of a Dutch telecommunication service provider by employing a duration model. While predicting churn, we simultaneously predict the reason for which the customer churns, using a competing risks model. Since the telecommunication service provider has valuable textual data based on transcripts of calls between customers and the customer service center, we incorporate topics extracted from this textual data as variables in our models, by employing Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). We compare four models and find that the models that have incorporated topic variables usually yield the best churn forecasts. Also, the investigated models beat the considered benchmark model, which is the model currently deployed at the telecommunication service provider".</p>
